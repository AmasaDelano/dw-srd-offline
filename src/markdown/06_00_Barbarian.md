## Starting Moves

**You are an outsider, so you get this move.**

### Outsider

You may be elf, dwarf, halfling, or human, but you and your people are not from around here. At the beginning of each session, the GM will **ask you something about your homeland**, why you left, or what you left behind. If you answer them, mark XP.

**You choose one of these moves to start with:**

### Full Plate And Packing Steel

You ignore the clumsy tag on armor you wear.

### Unencumbered, Unharmed

So long as you are below your Load and neither wear armor nor carry a shield, take +1 armor.

**You start with all of these moves:**

### Herculean Appetites

Others may content themselves with just a taste of wine, or dominion over a servant or two, but you want more. Choose two appetites. While **pursuing one of your appetites if you would roll for a move**, instead of rolling 2d6 you roll 1d6+1d8. If the d6 is the higher die of the pair, the GM will also introduce a complication or danger that comes about due to your heedless pursuits.

- Pure destruction
- Power over others
- Mortal pleasures
- Conquest
- Riches and property
- Fame and glory

### The Upper Hand

You take +1 ongoing to last breath rolls. When you **take your last breath**, on a 7–9 you make an offer to Death in return for your life. If Death accepts he will return you to life. If not, you die.

### Musclebound

While you wield a weapon it gains the forceful and messy tags.

### What Are You Waiting For?

When you **cry out a challenge to your enemies**, roll+CON. ✴On a 10+ they treat you as the most obvious threat to be dealt with and ignore your companions, take +2 damage ongoing against them. ✴On a 7–9 only a few (the weakest or most foolhardy among them) fall prey to your taunting.

## Alignment

**Choose an alignment:**

### Chaotic

Eschew a convention of the civilized world.

### Neutral

Teach someone the ways of your people.

## Gear

Your load is 8+STR. You carry dungeon rations (5 uses, 1 weight), a dagger (hand, 1 weight), and some token of where you’ve traveled or where you’re from. Choose your weapon:

- Axe (close, 1 weight)
- Two handed sword (close, +1 damage, 2 weight)

Choose one:

- Adventuring gear (1 weight) and dungeon rations (5 uses, 1 weight)
- Chainmail (1 armor, 1 weight)

## Bonds

Fill in the name of one of your companions in at least one:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is puny and foolish, but amusing to me.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_’s ways are strange and confusing.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is always getting into trouble—I must protect them from themselves.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ shares my hunger for glory; the earth will tremble at our passing!

## Advanced Moves

**When you gain a level from 2-5, choose from these moves.**

### Still Hungry

Choose an additional appetite.

### Appetite For Destruction

Take a move from the Fighter, Bard, or Thief class list. You may not take multiclass moves from those classes.

### My Love For You Is Like A Truck

When you **perform a feat of strength**, name someone present whom you have impressed and take +1 forward to parley with them.

### What Is Best In Life

At the end of a session, if during this session you have crushed your enemies, seen them driven before you, or have heard the lamentations of their kinfolk mark XP.

### Wide-Wanderer

You’ve travelled the wide world over. When you **arrive someplace** ask the GM about any important traditions, rituals, and so on, they’ll tell you what you need to know.

### Usurper

When you **prove yourself superior to a person in power**, take +1 forward with their followers, underlings, and hangers on.

### Khan Of Khans

Your hirelings always accept the gratuitous fulfillment of one of your appetites as payment.

### Samson

You may take a debility to immediately break free of any physical or mental restraint.

### Smash!

When you **Hack & Slash**, on a 12+ deal your damage and choose something physical your target has (a weapon, their position, a limb): they lose it.

### Indestructible Hunger

When you **take damage** you can choose to take -1 ongoing until you sate one of your appetites instead of taking the damage. If you already have this penalty you cannot choose this option.

### Eye For Weakness

When you **Discern Realities** add "What here is weak or vulnerable?" to the list of questions you can ask.

### On The Move

When you **defy a danger caused by movement** (maybe falling off a narrow bridge or rushing past an armed guard) take +1.

**When you gain a level from 6-10, choose from these moves or the level 2-5 moves.**

### A Good Day To Die

As long as you have less than your CON in current HP (or 1, whichever is higher) take +1 ongoing.

### Kill ‘Em All

*Requires: Appetite for Destruction*

Take another move from the Fighter, Bard, or Thief class list. You may not take multiclass moves from those classes.

### War Cry

When you **enter the battle with a show of force**, roll +CHA. ✴On a 10+ both. ✴On a 7-9 one or the other.

- Your allies are rallied and take +1 forward.
- Your enemies feel fear and act accordingly (avoiding you, hiding, attacking with fear-driven abandon)

### Mark Of Might

When you take this move and **spend some uninterrupted time reflecting on your past glories**, you may mark yourself with a symbol of your power (a long braid tied with bells, ritual scars or tattoos, etc.) Any intelligent mortal creature who sees this symbol knows instinctively that you are a force to be reckoned with and treats you appropriately.

### More! Always More!

When you **satisfy an appetite to the extreme** (destroying something unique and significant, gaining enormous fame, riches, power, etc.) you may choose to resolve it. Cross it off the list and mark XP. While you may pursue that appetite again, you no longer feel the burning desire you once did. In its place, choose a new appetite from the list or write your own.

### The One Who Knocks

When you **Defy Danger**, on a 12+ you turn the danger back on itself, the GM will describe how.

### Healthy Distrust

Whenever the unclean magic wielded by mortal men causes you to **Defy Danger**, treat any result of 6- as a 7–9.

### For The Blood God

You are initiated in the old ways, the ways of sacrifice. Choose something your gods (or the ancestor spirits, or your totem, etc) value—gold, blood, bones or the like. When you **sacrifice those things as per your rites and rituals**, roll+WIS. ✴On a 10+ the GM will grant you insight into your current trouble or a boon to help you. ✴On a 7-9 the sacrifice is not enough and your gods take of your flesh as well, but still grant you some insight or boon. ✴On a miss, you earn the ire of the fickle spirits.
