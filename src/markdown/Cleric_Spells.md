# Cleric Spells

## Rotes

Every time you commune, you gain access to all of your rotes without having to select them or count them toward your allotment of spells.

### Light Rote

An item you touch glows with divine light, about as bright as a torch. It gives off no heat or sound and requires no fuel but is otherwise like a mundane torch. You have complete control of the color of the flame. The spell lasts as long as it is in your presence.

### Sanctify Rote

Food or water you hold in your hands while you cast this spell is consecrated by your deity. In addition to now being holy or unholy, the affected substance is purified of any mundane spoilage.

### Guidance Rote

The symbol of your deity appears before you and gestures towards the direction or course of action your deity would have you take then disappears. The message is through gesture only; your communication through this spell is severely limited.

## Level 1 Spells

Your deity smiles upon a combatant of your choice. They take +1 ongoing so long as battle continues and they stand and fight. While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.

### Cure Light Wounds Level 1

At your touch wounds scab and bones cease to ache. Heal an ally you touch of 1d8 damage.

### Cause Fear Level 1 *Ongoing*

Choose a target you can see and a nearby object. The target is afraid of the object so long as you maintain the spell. Their reaction is up to them: flee, panic, beg, fight. While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell. You cannot target entities with less than animal intelligence \(magical constructs, undead, automatons, and the like\).

### Magic Weapon Level 1 *Ongoing*

The weapon you hold while casting does +1d4 damage until you dismiss this spell. While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.

As you cast this spell, you walk the perimeter of an area, consecrating it to your deity. As long as you stay within that area you are alerted whenever someone acts with malice within the sanctuary \(including entering with harmful intent\). Anyone who receives healing within a sanctuary heals +1d4 HP.

### Speak With Dead Level 1

A corpse converses with you briefly. It will answer any three questions you pose to it to the best of the knowledge it had in life and the knowledge it gained in death.

## Level 3 Spells

### Animate Dead Level 3 *Ongoing*

You invoke a hungry spirit to possess a recently-dead body and serve you. This creates a zombie that follows your orders to the best of its limited abilities. Treat the zombie as a character, but with access to only the basic moves. It has a +1 modifier for all stats and 1 HP. The zombie also gets your choice of 1d4 of these traits:

- It’s talented. Give one stat a +2 modifier.
- It’s durable. It has +2 HP for each level you have.
- It has a functioning brain and can complete complex tasks.
- It does not appear obviously dead, at least for a day or two.

The zombie lasts until it is destroyed by taking damage in excess of its HP, or until you end the spell. While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.

Cure Moderate Wounds Level 3

You staunch bleeding and set bones through magic. Heal an ally you touch of 2d8 damage.

### Darkness Level 3 *Ongoing*

Choose an area you can see: it’s filled with supernatural darkness and shadow. While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.

### Resurrection Level 3

Tell the GM you would like to resurrect a corpse whose soul has not yet fully departed this world. Resurrection is always possible, but the GM will give you one or more \(possibly all\) of these conditions to fulfill:

- It’s going to take days/weeks/months
- You must get help from \_\_\_\_
- It will require a lot of money
- You must sacrifice \_\_\_\_ to do it

The GM may, depending on the circumstances, allow you to resurrect the corpse now, with the understanding that the conditions must be met before it’s permanent, or require you to meet the conditions before the corpse is resurrected.

### Hold Person Level 3

Choose a person you can see. Until you cast a spell or leave their presence they cannot act except to speak. This effect ends immediately if the target takes damage from any source.

## Level 5 Spells

Choose a creature you can see. Until you end this spell, the target suffers from a disease of your choice. While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.

### Words of the Unspeaking Level 5

With a touch you speak to the spirits within things. The non-living object you touch answers three questions you pose, as best it can.

### True Seeing Level 5 *Ongoing*

Your vision is opened to the true nature of everything you lay your eyes on. You pierce illusions and see things that have been hidden. The GM will describe the area before you ignoring any illusions and falsehoods, magical or otherwise. While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.

### Trap Soul Level 5

You trap the soul of a dying creature within a gem. The trapped creature is aware of its imprisonment but can still be manipulated through spells, parley, and other effects. All moves against the trapped creature are at +1. You can free the soul at any time but it can never be recaptured once freed.

## Level 7 Spells

### Word of Recall Level 7

Choose a word. The first time after casting this spell that you speak the chosen word, you and any allies touching you when you cast the spell are immediately returned to the exact spot where you cast the spell. You can only maintain a single location; casting Word of Recall again before speaking the word replaces the earlier spell.

### Heal Level 7

Touch an ally and you may heal their damage a number of points up to your maximum HP.

### Harm Level 7

Touch an enemy and strike them with divine wrath—deal 2d8 damage to them and 1d6 damage to yourself. This damage ignores armor.

### Sever Level 7 *Ongoing*

Choose an appendage on the target such as an arm, tentacle, or wing. The appendage is magically severed from their body, causing no damage but considerable pain. Missing an appendage may, for example, keep a winged creature from flying, or a bull from goring you on its horns. While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.

### Mark of Death Level 7

### Consume Unlife Level 9

The mindless undead creature you touch is destroyed and you steal its death energy to heal yourself or the next ally you touch. The amount of damage healed is equal to the HP that the creature had remaining before you destroyed it.

### Plague Level 9 *Ongoing*

Name a city, town, encampment, or other place where people live. As long as this spell is active that place is beset by a plague appropriate to your deity’s domains \(locusts, death of the first born, etc.\) While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.
