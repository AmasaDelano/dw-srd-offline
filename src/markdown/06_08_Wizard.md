# The Wizard

Dungeon World has rules. Not the laws of men or the rule of some petty tyrant. Bigger, better rules. You drop something—it falls. You can’t make something out of nothing. The dead stay dead, right?

Oh, the things we tell ourselves to feel better about the long, dark nights.

You’ve spent so very long poring over those tomes of yours. The experiments that nearly drove you mad and all the botched summonings that endangered your very soul. For what? For power. What else is there? Not just the power of King or Country but the power to boil a man’s blood in his veins. To call on the thunder of the sky and the churn of the roiling earth. To shrug off the rules the world holds so dear.

Let them cast their sidelong glances. Let them call you “warlock” or “diabolist.” Who among them can hurl fireballs from their eyes?

Yeah. We didn’t think so.

Haunted Eyes, Sharp Eyes, or Crazy Eyes

Styled Hair, Wild Hair, or Pointed Hat

Worn Robes, Stylish Robes, or Strange Robes

Pudgy Body, Creepy Body, or Thin Body

## Stats

Your maximum HP is 4+Constitution.

Your base damage is d4.

## Starting Moves

**Choose a race and gain the corresponding move:**

### Elf

Magic is as natural as breath to you. Detect Magic is a cantrip for you.

### Human

Choose one cleric spell. You can cast it as if it was a wizard spell.

**You start with these moves:**

### Spellbook

You have mastered several spells and inscribed them in your spellbook. You start out with three first level spells in your spellbook as well as the cantrips. Whenever you gain a level, you add a new spell of your level or lower to your spellbook. You spellbook is 1 weight.

### Prepare Spells

When you **spend uninterrupted time \(an hour or so\) in quiet contemplation of your spellbook**, you:

- Lose any spells you already have prepared
- Prepare new spells of your choice from your spellbook whose total levels don’t exceed your own level+1.
- Prepare your cantrips which never count against your limit.

---

You can prepare the same spell more than once if you like.

### Cast a Spell \(INT\)

When you **release a spell you’ve prepared**, roll+INT. ✴On a 10+, the spell is successfully cast and you do not forget the spell—you may cast it again later. ✴On a 7-9, the spell is cast, but choose one:

- You draw unwelcome attention or put yourself in a spot. The GM will tell you how.
- The spell disturbs the fabric of reality as it is cast—take -1 ongoing to cast a spell until the next time you Prepare Spells.
- After it is cast, the spell is forgotten. You cannot cast the spell again until you prepare spells.

Note that maintaining spells with ongoing effects will sometimes cause a penalty to your roll to cast a spell.

### Spell Defense

You may end any ongoing spell immediately and use the energy of its dissipation to deflect an oncoming attack. The spell ends and you subtract its level from the damage done to you.

### Ritual

When you **draw on a place of power to create a magical effect**, tell the GM what you’re trying to achieve. Ritual effects are always possible, but the GM will give you one to four of the following conditions:

- It’s going to take days/weeks/months
- First you must \_\_\_\_
- You’ll need help from \_\_\_\_
- It will require a lot of money
- The best you can do is a lesser version, unreliable and limited
- You and your allies will risk danger from \_\_\_\_
- You’ll have to disenchant \_\_\_\_ to do it

## Alignment

**Choose an alignment:**

### Good

Use magic to directly aid another.

### Neutral

Discover something about a magical mystery.

### Evil

Use magic to cause terror and fear.

## Gear

Your load is 7+STR. You start with your spellbook \(1 weight\) and dungeon rations \(5 uses, 1 weight\). Choose your defenses:

- Leather armor \(1 armor, 1 weight\)
- Bag of books \(5 uses, 2 weight\) and 3 healing potions

Choose your weapon:

- Dagger \(hand, 1 weight\)
- Staff \(close, two-handed, 1 weight\)

Choose one:

- Healing potion \(0 weight\)
- 3 antitoxins \(0 weight\)

## Bonds

Fill in the name of one of your companions in at least one:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ will play an important role in the events to come. I have foreseen it\!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is keeping an important secret from me.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is woefully misinformed about the world; I will teach them all that I can.

## Advanced Moves

**When you gain a level from 2-5, choose from these moves. You also add a new spell to your spellbook at each level.**

### Prodigy

Choose a spell. You prepare that spell as if it were one level lower.

### Empowered Magic

When you cast a spell, on a 10+ you have the option of choosing from the 7-9 list. If you do, you may choose one of these as well:

- The spell’s effects are maximized
- The spell’s targets are doubled

---

Maximizing the effects of a spell is simple for spells that involve a roll: a maximized Magic Missile does 8 damage. In other cases it’s down to the circumstances. If there’s no clear way to maximize it you can’t choose that option.

Likewise for doubling the targets. If the spell doesn’t have targets you can’t choose to double them.

### Fount of Knowledge

When you **spout lore about something no one else has any clue about**, take +1.

### Know-It-All

When **another player’s character comes to you for advice and you tell them what you think is best**, they get +1 forward when following your advice and you mark experience if they do.

### Expanded Spellbook

Add a new spell from the spell list of any class to your spellbook.

### Enchanter

When you have time and safety with a magic item you may ask the GM what it does, the GM will answer you truthfully.

### Logical

When you **use strict deduction to analyze your surroundings**, you can discern realities with INT instead of WIS.

### Arcane Ward

As long as you have at least one prepared spell of first level or higher, you have +2 armor.

### Counterspell

When you **attempt to counter an arcane spell that will otherwise affect you**, stake one of your prepared spells on the defense and roll+INT. ✴On a 10+, the spell is countered and has no effect on you. ✴On a 7-9, the spell is countered and you forget the spell you staked. Your counterspell protects only you; if the countered spell has other targets they get its effects.

### Quick Study

When you **see the effects of an arcane spell**, ask the GM the name of the spell and its effects. You take +1 when acting on the answers.

**When you gain a level from 6-10, choose from these moves or the level 2-5 moves.**

### Master

*Requires: Prodigy*

Choose one spell in addition to the one you picked for prodigy. You prepare that spell as if it were one level lower.

### Greater Empowered Magic

*Replaces: Empowered Magic*

When you cast a spell, on a 10-11 you have the option of choosing from the 7-9 list. If you do, you may choose one of these effects as well. On a 12+ you get to choose one of these effects for free:

- The spell’s effects are doubled
- The spell’s targets are doubled

### Enchanter’s Soul

*Requires: Enchanter*

When you have time and safety with a magic item in a place of power you can empower that item so that the next time you use it its effects are amplified, the GM will tell you exactly how.

### Highly Logical

*Replaces: Logical*

When you **use strict deduction to analyze your surroundings**, you can discern realities with INT instead of WIS. On a 12+ you get to ask the GM any three questions, not limited by the list.

### Arcane Armor

*Replaces: Arcane Ward*

As long as you have at least one prepared spell of first level or higher, you have +4 armor.

### Protective Counter

*Requires: Counterspell*

When an ally within sight of you is affected by an arcane spell, you can counter it as if it affected you. If the spell affects multiple allies you must counter for each ally separately.

### Ethereal Tether

When you have time with a willing or helpless subject you can craft an ethereal tether with them. You perceive what they perceive and can discern realities about someone tethered to you or their surroundings no matter the distance. Someone willingly tethered to you can communicate with you over the tether as if you were in the room with them.

### Mystical Puppet Strings

When you **use magic to control a person’s actions** they have no memory of what you had them do and bear you no ill will.

### Spell Augmentation

When you **deal damage to a creature** you can shunt a spell’s energy into them—end one of your ongoing spells and add the spell’s level to the damage dealt.

### Self-Powered

When you have time, arcane materials, and a safe space, you can create your own place of power. Describe to the GM what kind of power it is and how you’re binding it to this place, the GM will tell you one kind of creature that will have an interest in your workings.

## Wizard Spells

### Cantrips

You prepare all of your cantrips every time you prepare spells without having to select them or count them toward your allotment of spells.

#### Light

*Cantrip*

An item you touch glows with arcane light, about as bright as a torch. It gives off no heat or sound and requires no fuel, but it is otherwise like a mundane torch. You have complete control of the color of the flame. The spell lasts as long as it is in your presence.

#### Unseen Servant

*Cantrip, Ongoing*

You conjure a simple invisible construct that can do nothing but carry items. It has load 3 and carries anything you hand to it. It cannot pick up items on its own and can only carry those you give to it. Items carried by an unseen servant appear to float in the air a few paces behind you. An unseen servant that takes damage or leaves your presence is immediately dispelled, dropping any items it carried. Otherwise the unseen servant serves you until you end the spell.

#### Prestidigitation

*Cantrip*

You perform minor tricks of true magic. If you touch an item as part of the casting you can make cosmetic changes to it: clean it, soil it, cool it, warm it, flavor it, or change its color. If you cast the spell without touching an item you can instead create minor illusions no bigger than yourself. Prestidigitation illusions are crude and clearly illusions—they won’t fool anyone, but they might entertain them.

### Level 1 Spells

#### Contact Spirits

*Level 1, Summoning*

Name the spirit you wish to contact \(or leave it to the GM\). You pull that creature through the planes, just close enough to speak to you. It is bound to answer any one question you ask to the best of its ability.

#### Detect Magic

*Level 1, Divination*

One of your senses is briefly attuned to magic. The GM will tell you what here is magical.

#### Telepathy

*Level 1, Divination Ongoing*

You form a telepathic bond with a single person you touch, enabling you to converse with that person through your thoughts. You can only have one telepathic bond at a time.

#### Charm Person

*Level 1, Enchantment Ongoing*

The person \(not beast or monster\) you touch while casting this spell counts you as a friend until they take damage or you prove otherwise.

#### Invisibility

*Level 1, Illusion Ongoing*

Touch an ally: nobody can see them. They’re invisible\! The spell persists until the target attacks or you dismiss the effect. While the spell is ongoing you can’t cast a spell.

#### Magic Missile

*Level 1, Evocation*

Projectiles of pure magic spring from your fingers. Deal 2d4 damage to one target.

#### Alarm

*Level 1*

Walk a wide circle as you cast this spell. Until you prepare spells again your magic will alert you if a creature crosses that circle. Even if you are asleep, the spell will shake you from your slumber.

### Level 3 Spells

#### Dispel Magic

*Level 3*

Choose a spell or magic effect in your presence: this spell rips it apart. Lesser spells are ended, powerful magic is just reduced or dampened so long as you are nearby.

---

The exact effects depend on the circumstances. A goblin orkaster’s spell might just be ended, while a deity’s consecration is probably just dimmed. The GM will tell you the likely effects of Dispelling a given effect before you cast.

#### Visions Through Time

*Level 3, Divination*

Cast this spell and gaze into a reflective surface to see into the depths of time. The GM will reveal the details of a grim portent to you—a bleak event that will come to pass without your intervention. They’ll tell you something useful about how you can interfere with the grim portent’s dark outcomes. Rare is the portent that claims “You’ll live happily ever after.” Sorry.

#### Fireball

*Level 3, Evocation*

You evoke a mighty ball of flame that envelops your target and everyone nearby, inflicting 2d6 damage which ignores armor.

---

“Nearby” depends on context; a few paces or so in an open space, considerably more in an enclosed room. Be careful\!.

#### Mimic

*Level 3, Ongoing*

You take the form of someone you touch while casting this spell. Your physical characteristics match theirs exactly but your behavior may not. This change persists until you take damage or choose to return to your own form. While this spell is ongoing you lose access to all your wizard moves.

#### Mirror Image

*Level 3, Illusion*

You create an illusory image of yourself. When you are attacked, roll a d6. On a 4, 5, or 6 the attack hits the illusion instead, the image then dissipates and the spell ends.

#### Sleep

*Level 3, Enchantment*

1d4 enemies you can see of the GM’s choice fall asleep. Only creatures capable of sleeping are affected. They awake as normal: loud noises, jolts, pain.

### Level 5 Spells

#### Cage

*Level 5, Evocation Ongoing*

The target is held in a cage of magical force. Nothing can get in or out of the cage. The cage remains until you cast another spell or dismiss it. While the spell is ongoing, the caged creature can hear your thoughts and you cannot leave sight of the cage.

#### Contact Other Plane

*Level 5, Divination*

You send a request to another plane. Specify who or what you’d like to contact by location, type of creature, name, or title. You open a two-way communication with that creature. Your communication can be cut off at any time by you or the creature you contacted.

#### Polymorph

*Level 5, Enchantment*

Your touch reshapes a creature entirely, they stay in the form you craft until you cast a spell. Describe the new shape you craft, including any stat changes, significant adaptations, or major weaknesses. The GM will then tell you one or more of these:

- The form will be unstable and temporary
- The creature’s mind will be altered as well
- The form has an unintended benefit or weakness

---

In some cases the GM may choose the last option more than once to list each unexpected benefit or weakness.

#### Summon Monster

*Level 5, Summoning Ongoing*

A monster appears and aids you as best it can. Treat it as your character, but with access to only the basic moves. It has +1 modifier for all stats, 1 HP, and uses your damage dice. The monster also gets your choice of 1d6 of these traits:

- It has +2 instead of +1 to one stat
- It’s not reckless
- It does 1d8 damage
- Its bond to your plane is strong: +2 HP for each level you have
- It has some useful adaptation

The GM will tell you the type of monster you get based on the traits you select. The creature remains on this plane until it dies or you dismiss it. While the spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.

---

The exact type of monster you get is up to the GM, based on your choices. If you want a non-reckless swimming creature you might get a water elemental, a 1d8 damage +2 STR creature might be a barbed devil. Whatever the creature is you still get to play it.

### Level 7 Spells

#### Dominate

*Level 7, Enchantment Ongoing*

Your touch pushes your mind into someone else’s. You gain 1d4 hold. Spend one hold to make the target take one of these actions:

- Speak a few words of your choice
- Give you something they hold
- Make a concerted attack on a target of your choice
- Truthfully answer one question

If you run out of hold the spell ends. If the target takes damage you lose 1 hold. While the spell is ongoing you cannot cast a spell.

#### True Seeing

*Level 7, Divination Ongoing*

You see all things as they truly are. This effect persists until you tell a lie or dismiss the spell. While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.

#### Shadow Walk

*Level 7, Illusion*

The shadows you target with this spell become a portal for you and your allies. Name a location, describing it with a number of words up to your level. Stepping through the portal deposits you and any allies present when you cast the spell at the location you described. The portal may only be used once by each ally.

#### Contingency

*Level 7, Evocation*

Choose a 5th level or lower spell you know. Describe a trigger condition using a number of words equal to your level. The chosen spell is held until you choose to unleash it or the trigger condition is met, whichever happens first. You don’t have to roll for the held spell, it just takes effect. You may only have a single contingent spell held at a time; if you cast Contingency while you have a held spell, the new held spell replaces the old one.

#### Cloudkill

*Level 7, Summoning Ongoing*

A cloud of fog drifts into this realm from beyond the Black Gates of Death, filling the immediate area. Whenever a creature in the area takes damage it takes an additional, separate 1d6 damage which ignores armor. This spell persists so long as you can see the affected area, or until you dismiss it.

### Level 9 Spells

#### Antipathy

*Level 9, Enchantment Ongoing*

Choose a target and describe a type of creature or an alignment. Creatures of the specified type or alignment cannot come within sight of the target. If a creature of the specified type does find itself within sight of the target, it immediately flees. This effect continues until you leave the target’s presence or you dismiss the spell. While the spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.

#### Alert

*Level 9, Divination*

Describe an event. The GM will tell you when that event occurs, no matter where you are or how far away the event is. If you choose, you can view the location of the event as though you were there in person. You can only have one Alert active at a time.

#### Soul Gem

*Level 9*

You trap the soul of a dying creature within a gem. The trapped creature is aware of its imprisonment but can still be manipulated through spells, parley, and other effects. All moves against the trapped creature are at +1. You can free the soul at any time but it can never be recaptured once freed.

#### Shelter

*Level 9, Evocation Ongoing*

You create a structure out of pure magical power. It can be as large as a castle or as small as a hut, but is impervious to all non-magical damage. The structure endures until you leave it or you end the spell.

#### Perfect Summons

*Level 9, Summoning*

You teleport a creature to your presence. Name a creature or give a short description of a type of creature. If you named a creature, that creature appears before you. If you described a type of creature, a creature of that type appears before you.
